# uriAnchor #

## Summary ##

A jQuery plugin for management of the URI hash component.

Use this plugin to manage dependent and independent variables in the hash 
fragment of the URI.  It has been designed and updated over five commercial
SPA projects and is featured in the book
[Single page web applications - JavaScript end-to-end](http://manning.com/mikowski).
It provides the capability to make the URI fragment your application state API. 
Bookmarks, browser history, the back button, and the forward button can all be made 
to act as the user expects while enabling you to update only the part of the page 
that has changed.

## Methods ##

### $.uriAnchor.setAnchor ##

#### Purpose ####

Sets Anchor component of the URI from a Map
(The Anchor component is also known as the
'hash fragment' or 'bookmark component')

#### Arguments ####

Arguments are positional:

- 1 ( `anchor_map` ) : The map to be encoded to the URI anchor
- 2 ( `option_map` ) : A map of options
- 3 ( `replace_flag` ) : A boolean flag.  When true, the method replaces the URI so that prior URI is not entered into the browser history

#### Environment ####

Expects the document.location browser object

#### Settings ####

none

#### Returns ####

boolean: true on success, false on failure

#### Throws ####

none

#### Details ####

The first positional argument, `anchor_map`, may be a simple map:

    $.uriAnchor.setAnchor({
      page   : 'profile',
      slider : 'confirm',
      color  : 'red'
    });

This changes the URI anchor to:

    #!page=profile&slider=confirm&color=red

All these arguments are independent, that is, they can vary
independent of each other. We also support dependent values -
values that depend on others.

An independent argument key has no `_` prefix.  The same key name,
prefixed by an `_`, holds the arguments that are dependent on
an independent argument. The dependent key always points
to a map. Consider:

    $.uriAnchor.setAnchor({
      page   : 'profile',
      _page  : {
        uname   : 'wendy',
        online  : 'today'
      }
    });

This changes the URI Anchor to:

    #!page=profile:uname,wendy|online,today

Only independent keys and their matching dependent keys are
processed.  All other keys are ignored.  Importantly, this includes
keys of the form `_s_<key>` ( e.g. `_s_page` ) returned by makeAnchorMap

Setting a more complex anchor map is illustrated below:

    $.uriAnchor.setAnchor({
      page : 'profile',
      _page : {
        uname   : 'wendy',
        online  : 'today'
      },
      slider  : 'confirm',
      _slider : {
       text   : 'hello',
       pretty : false
      },
      color : 'red'
    });

This sets the URI Anchor to:

     #!page=profile:uname,wendy|online,today&slider=confirm:text,hello\
       |pretty,false&color=red

Options: The second positional argument tp this method, `option_map`,
provides a number of options for delimiters:

- `delimit_char`   : Delimiter between independent args. Default is `&`.
- `delimit_kv_char`: Delimiter between key and value of independent args.  Default is `=`.
- `sub_delimit_char` : Delimiter between independent and dependent args. Defaults is `:`.
* `dep_delimit_char` : Delimiter between key-value pairs in dependent args. Default is `|`.
- `dep_kv_delimit_char` : Delimiter between key and value of dependent args.  Default is ','

Boolean values ( as part of a key-value pair ) are convert into the stings 'true' or 'false'.

Validation:

As of 1.0, the ability to optionally check the validity of the
Anchor against a schema has been included.  Since we don't expect
the allowable schema to change during run-time, we use a
module configuration to set the schema, like so:

    $uriAnchor.configModule({
      schema_map : {
        page    : { profile : true, pdf : true },
        _page   : {
          uname   : true,
          online  : { 'today','yesterday','earlier' }
        },
        slider  : { confirm : 'deny' },
        _slider : { text : 'goodbye' },
        color   : { red : true, green : true, blue : true }
      }
    });

This check occurs only during setting of the Anchor, not
during its parsing ( See makeAnchorMap )

The `replace_flag` instructs the routine to replace the URI,
discarding browser history


### $.uriAnchor.makeAnchorMap

#### Purpose

 Parses URI anchor and returns as map

#### Arguments

 none

#### Environment

 Expects the document.location browser object

#### Settings

 none

#### Returns

 Map

#### Throws

 none


#### Details

Parses the browser URI anchor into a map using the same
rules used to set the anchor in the method setAnchor
( see above ).

This method creates an additional key type, `_s_<indendent_arg>`
for each independent argument with dependent arguments.

These keys point to a string representation of the independent
argument along with all its dependent arguments.

These values are ignored by setAnchor, but they are useful
for routines using setAnchor to check if a part of the anchor
has changed.

#### Example

If the browser URI Anchor looks like this:

    #!page=profile:uname,wendy|online,true&slider=confirm:text,hello\
      |pretty,false&color=red

Then calling $.uriAnchor.makeAnchorMap(); will return a map that looks like so:

    { page : 'profile',
      _page : {
        uname   : 'wendy',
        online  : 'today'
      },
      _s_page : 'profile:uname,wendy|online,today',
      slider  : 'confirm',
      _slider : {
       text   : 'hello',
       pretty : false
      },
      _s_slider : 'confirm:text,hello|pretty,false',
      color : 'red'
    };

## TODO ##

- Maybe reconsider the structure of dependent and indepent variables
